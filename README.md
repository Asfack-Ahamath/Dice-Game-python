## Gameplay Rules

1. The game starts when the human player rolls a 6.
2. Players move forward by half the dice roll value (rounded down).
3. Black holes are positioned at blocks 7 and 14. Landing on one resets the player's position to 1.
4. The first player to reach or exceed block 20 wins the game.
5. Game results include the total moves and black hole encounters for both players.
